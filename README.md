# Pima_Diabetes_Classification
Supervised classification for Pima Diabetes dataset

The Jupyter Notebook file contains Python code for XGBoost classification.
The code begins with data visualization and is followed by base model classification followed by hyperparameter optimization using
hyperopt, RandomizedSearchCV and finally GridSearchCV using Cross-Validations.

Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and AUC (Area Under Curve) are used for measuring model performance
